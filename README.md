# Palindrome Checker
A simple string manipulation exercise to test for palindromes or words and sentences that can still be spell the same when reversed. I've used regular expressions to ignore all special characters.

Details

* palindrome checker is not case sensitive – the word “Madam” will still pass as palindrome <br>
* It will ignore spaces and special characters <br>

Sample output 1: <br>
Enter word/phrase: Rotator <br>
Rotator is a palindrome <br>
 
Sample output 2: <br>
Enter word/phrase: Won’t lovers revolt now? <br>
Won’t lovers revolt now? is a palindrome <br>
 
Sample output 3: <br>
Enter word/phrase: Hello World! <br>
Hello World! is NOT a palindrome <br>
